### 📊 Data Pipeline
A modular Python project for processing company data, profiling ethnicity, scoring loans, and managing model pipelines. This system is designed to support data preprocessing, transformation, and data pipeline automation.

### 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash```
pip install -r r.txt
```bash```

### 🧠 Key Components

1. main.py
The main entry point of the project. It likely wires together the processing modules into a single execution pipeline.

2. Processor/data_pipeline.py
The core orchestration logic where different processing components are combined and managed.

3. custom_json_to_csv_converter.py
Used for converting JSON data into CSV format — possibly to prepare data for training or reporting.

### 🧩 Modules Overview

### 📂 Company_House
Processes official UK company registry data.

company_house.py: Loads and cleans data from Companies House.

### 📂 Ethnicity_Profile
Performs ethnicity analysis based on name or demographic data.

ethnicity_profile.py: Handles profiling and tagging of ethnic attributes.

### 📂 Loan_Scoring
Contains loan scoring algorithms or models.

loan_scoring.py: Computes scores based on features derived from input data.

### 📂 Models
Contains definitions or wrappers for ML models.

models.py: May include training, saving, loading, and inference logic.

### 📂 Processor
Modular processing logic.

checkpoint_processor.py: Used to save progress or resume pipeline runs.

company_matcher.py: Links company data to existing datasets.

data_pipeline.py: The glue code that runs the entire processing logic.

### ⚙️ Usage
